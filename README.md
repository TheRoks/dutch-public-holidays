## Developing

DutchPublicHolidays uses <code>grunt >= 0.4.x</code>. Make sure to upgrade your environment and read the
[Migration Guide](http://gruntjs.com/upgrading-from-0.3-to-0.4).

Dependencies for building from source and running tests:

* [grunt-cli](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli) - run: `$ npm install -g grunt-cli`
* Then, install the development dependencies by running `$ npm install` from the project directory

There are a number of targets in the gruntfile that are used to generating different builds:

* `grunt`: Perform a normal build, runs jshint and karma tests
* `grunt build`: Perform a normal build
* `grunt dist`: Perform a clean build and generate documentation
* `grunt dev`: Run dev server (sample app) and watch for changes, builds and runs karma tests on changes.
